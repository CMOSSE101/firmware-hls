HLS implementation of the tracklet firmware

This repository is for studies of the C/C++ implementation for firmware using Vivado HLS. 

Source code goes in TrackletAlgorithm/, configuration/steering files go in project/; test bench code goes in ... TestBench. Memory printouts from emulation are in emData/.

A project can be generated by running tcl file with Vivado HLS in firmware-hls/project/ directory. One example project for testing ProjectionRouter:

vivado_hls -f script_PR.tcl

It would create a project directory <project> ("projrouter" in case of the above example). The project name is defined in the tcl script. To open the project in GUI:

vivado_hls -p <project>


This is intended to be the HLS implementation of this repository:
https://github.com/cms-tracklet/fpga_emulation_longVM/tree/fw_synch, specifically this tag:
https://github.com/cms-tracklet/fpga_emulation_longVM/tree/AR_181022

This is the fw_synch branch. See readme in that area.
